This revision contains minor changes to the workflow, mostly involving additional elaboration in text. This includes suggestions for the number of replicates in the experimental design, guidelines for interpreting the mapping statistics and BCV plots, explanations of the choices for some parameter settings (in particular, mapping quality thresholds, spacings and bin sizes for the CBP data set) and additional notes about alternative strategies for blacklisting and annotation. In the code blocks, calls to the 'normalize' function were updated to 'normOffsets' to reflect changes in the latest version of the csaw package. Calls to 'align' were similarly updated to make use of new options in the latest version of the Rsubread package. Figure 2 was modified to include "log-CPM" in the x-axis label for clarification. An additional figure (Figure 12) was added upon a request from a reviewer and contains a MDS plot for the CBP data set.
